      "Programming is becoming increasingly more important in our age.  One of the results of this is that programming is becoming increasingly accessible.  The age of punch cards, or even the days of needing to know that computers run on binary, are long over.  Programming is now something available to the masses.  Knowing how to program is also an investment.  It is the digital embodiment of spending time upfront in order to avoid far greater time costs later.  Once you learn, you will never have to do a formulaic task on a computer more than once ever again.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those that have not yet touched [pset0](#) from ARC, please do, it is very important that you have the fundamentals down before we go further. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now why did I even mention, let alone title the pset here: cs50? Well, CS50 attempts to teach the best and the brightest of our age how to program.  It is reputed by many to be the hardest class they took at Harvard.  It teaches you to program in the language C, which is about as close as anyone, save an operating system designer, gets these days to telling the processor, memory, and hard disk explicitly what to do.  While this is in fact what most programming boils down to, this is only useful to those who will end up pursuing programming as a career.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the rest of the world, knowing how to program is about as useful as knowing how to drive a car (namely, very useful).  But there\u2019s no reason you need to know how to build a car in order to know how to drive it.  Equivalently, there is no reason you need to know C to be a programmer.  Hence, [ARC](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/harvard-arc/) has re-written CS50 in Python, a language much better suited to learning how to program since it puts you a safe distance above the hardware while still giving you all the power you want.  This is no mere tutorial, but a course in its own right.  As far as courses go, it should be very short.  ARC intends to teach you nearly everything CS50 does in under a four hours.  After all, programming is all about saving time.\n",

      "So, now, welcome to [Python](http://www.python.org/).  Named after Monty Python, Python is a magnificent language in that it packs power into human readable code, at the same time as being widely used in industry.  Hence, it is ideal for many reasons as a first coding language.  Perhaps the hardest thing for experienced programmers about Python is dealing with just how much it does for you.  Many things you want to do in Python are already done.  For the sake of this course, you should ignore this fact, and try to write everything yourself.  However, in the real world, Google is your friend.  A search for \"Python [something]\" will probably reveal far more about how to do [something] in Python than you ever wanted to know, and you may spend more time reading about how to use functions that already do everything you want than actually writing code.  But before you can do that, you have to learn how to code. Please note that this tutorial is written in Python 2.7, and is not entirely forward compatible to 3.x.  Now lets get started. The lovely part about ipython, is that we can execute code right here \n"

Why does that code run forever?  x is clearly greater than 10 in the loop, and it\u2019s supposed to only loop while x is less than or equal to 10 (that\u2019s what the \"<=\" is; there is also a \">=\" for greater than or equals to, and \">\" for greater than).  But, whenever it reaches the beginning of the loop again, x has been set back to 0, which is less than 10, and so the loop will run again.  It will keep printing 30, because whenever it prints, x has the value 30, but it will also keep looping, because when it checks the loop, x is 0.  This illustrates another principle of programming.

Problem set 1 had you build strings out of pieces.  But what exactly is a string?  Well, it\u2019s a string of characters, sure, but that\u2019s not very precise.  The technical term in the case of a string is that it is an \"array\" of characters.  What is an array?  It\u2019s like a list, but more rigid in structure.  In an array, all the elements must be the same kind of thing; in the case of a string, they must all be characters.  And what is a character?  It\u2019s a single letter or symbol.  But beneath that, it\u2019s actually just a number in memory: http://www.asciitable.com.  Why is it a number?  Well, computers store things in binary.  In order to use anything, it has to get encoded into and out of binary at some point.  But that\u2019s about all you have to care about binary.

      "That should have printed \"T\" and \"84\".  Why?  Well, \"T\" is the first character of the string.  The string is just an array of characters, and `string[n]` returns the nth element of that array (this works for lists too).  And here comes something from a while back that I wasn\u2019t actually joking about: computer scientists start counting from zero.  Thus, the first character in the string is actually the zeroth element in the character array that the string represents, and so is accessed by `string[0] (string[1]` will return \"h\" in this case).  The \"ord(character)\" function converts a single character into its ASCII or \"ordinal\" value.  If you look at an ASCII table, you will find that \"T\" has the decimal value 84.  And so, `ord(\"T\")` returns 84.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "In many lower level programing languages, individual characters must be referred to using \u2018single quotes\u2019 rather than \"double quotes\" (so \u2018T\u2019, not \"T\"), but Python is very forgiving, and will actually let you use single and double quotes interchangeably.  Thus, in Python, a character and a single length string are completely equivalent, which is a kindness many other programming languages will not extend you.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "But, enough on why Python is great.  Why do you care that `ord(\"T\")` is 84?  Because, it turns out that `ord(\"U\")` is 85.  And `ord(\"V\")` is 86.  The capital letters take on ASCII values 65 through 90 and the lowercase take on 97 through 122.  But, now that you know that, never look it up again.  Just reference them with `ord(\"A\"), ord(\"Z\"), ord(\"a\")`, and `ord(\"z\")`.  And, once you have the value for a character you want, turn it back into a character with the \"chr(value)\" function.\n"

In order to use the backslash itself in a string (it is what is called an escape character), you have to preface it with another backslash: \"\\\\\".

Python will do a thing called \u201cbuffering\u201d, where it stores pending writes to a file in memory, and then sends them all out to the file in a batch.  This helps it run faster, but sometimes is a pain.  If you need stuff written NOW, use \u201cf.flush()\u201d to force python to write its buffered writes to the file.

To start it at the end, open the file in append mode, via \u201copen(filename, \u2018a\u2019)\u201d.  The one reason I mention that the file object tracks your location is because after you have iterated through a file, using something like \u201cfor line in file\u201d, you have to open the file again if you want to iterate over it again.

Why don\u2019t you want to then surround your code with giant try-except blocks?  Because your code crashing is often a useful debugging tool.  Your code crashing means something you didn\u2019t expect happened.  A lot of the time (like, almost all of it), this is because of code you wrote and need to fix.
